<h1>Drk.Dev page:</h1>
<strong>Drk.Dev page</strong> is a place where i plan to constantly update in order to improve my skills in WebDevelopment and some others.<br>
By the way, if yoy have any good idea of a project to add or want to add it yourself don't feel afraid of opening a pull request.

<h4>What for now?</h4>
For the initial provisory project i've build a simple yet very interesting <em>login page</em>, it doesn't have any other pages below on its tree for now, but soon this wont be the main page of the project anyway.<br>
I'll make some small updates for this pages only for its visual until i start developing the main index.html of the project, soon when i've finished the main page ill come back with major updates for this 'provisory' page.

<h4>You have somenthing to tell me?</h4>
You can contact-me through my Discord (dark1zin_), just this way cause uh... yes?

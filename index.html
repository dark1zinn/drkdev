            <h3>Who am I?</h3><img src="https://github.com/dark1zinn.png" alt="avatar" width="130px">
            <p>
                My username is <strong><a href="https://github.com/dark1zinn" target="_blank">dark1zinn</a></strong>, i use it pretty much everywhere, on the games i from the games i play to all my accounts accross the web, why this choice?<br>
                Well, it was a long time ago when i was 12 or 13 years old, i think this "cool username" thing happened to a lot of people that time.<br>
                I started using this username everywhere and now to change it would be so much effort to do, then i decided to just adopt this username, and yes, i do like it.<br>
                <br>
                Anyways, my actual name is <em>Edilson</em>, but most people call me by <em>Juininho</em>, the close ones of course. (That's all you need to know about my actual 'life')<br>
                <br>
                My country, my beloved side of the world, <strong>BRASIL!!</strong> <img src="https://emojiguide.com/wp-content/uploads/platform/google/43751.png" width="30px"><br>
                I'm from Brasil, <strong>with an S, not with that shitty "z"</strong>, i was born a brasillian, and for GOD sake, what a hardcore place, i know i live here and yes i do love my country, but sometimes i think on how i'm still going on with all that's happening around here.
